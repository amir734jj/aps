\title{Quasi-Ordering for Dependency Scheduling}
\author{John Boyland and Amir Hesamian}
\date{DRAFT \today}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Unlike many graphs, a dependency graph may have loops (edges from a vertex to itself).  The presence of a loop makes a difference to the graph, since it represents a self-dependency.  Thus representing (the transitive closure of) a dependency graph as a partial order over strongly connected components loses some information: are the single-element components involved in a self-dependency or not?  We propose a new algebraic structure: the \emph{quasi order}, for which we have partial and total versions.  Any transitive dependency relation can be represented as a quasi partial order, and any schedule of such a relation can be represented as a quasi total order. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Motivation}

Consider the following dependency graph with vertices for A, B, C, D, E, F, G
on the left of the following figure. On the right is a representation the quasi partial order for the dependency relation on the left.  Below, we have one possible quasi total order (schedule) for the dependency relation:
